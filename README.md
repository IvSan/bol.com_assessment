# Intro to the bol.com game

This project represents technical assignment for bol.com with following task:

The purpose of this assignment is to showcase your programming skills. It's not so
much about finishing and solving the problem but about delivering a well-designed
solution with code that makes you proud. Because we would like to judge your
Java skills, we would like you to do this in Java.

The assignment is to program a web application game using frameworks you are
familiar with.

This web application should enable 2 players to play the game (no AI required). It
doesn't need a fancy web interface as we don't need a designer in the team ;-).
However, feel free to make it as fancy as you want, if you want to show off a bit.

While making the test please take the following points into consideration:

- Readability and comprehensibility of the code (Clean code)
- Testing your solution (e.g Unit testing)
- Conscious design/technical decisions

As the purpose of this exercise is to gain insights into how you approach building
software, we do not need you to deliver a finished product with the complete UI. It
should be something you feel comfortable presenting to us and you should be able
to explain the choices you've made along the way.

It should take you approximately 6-8 hours to deliver a solution, but feel free to
spend more time if you feel really excited about it!

We hope you will enjoy working on this assignment, and if you have any
questions please do not hesitate to contact us!
